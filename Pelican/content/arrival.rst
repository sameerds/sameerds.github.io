"*PhD is a state of mind, not a degree,*" they say! Well, one of the characteristics of this "state of mind" is the ability to make extra-ordinary statements about trivial matters, I believe.

| The walk from hostel to department or back, is usually spent on such trivial matters of extreme significance. Today was a rather productive day, since Shantanu and I came up with two great lines!
| 
| First was when we saw a fellow student walk rapidly in what seemed like a great hurry to the department. We were walking at a rather slow pace, taking the sights along the way ... the best way to describe it?

   "We never *go* to a place, we *arrive*!"

The second one was a result of a discussion about taking responsibility when things go wrong ...

   "If you want the *fame*, gotta take the *blame*. There's no *shame* in that!"
