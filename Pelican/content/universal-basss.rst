There was a time, when people bought Nokia phones because other people had Nokia phones. That way there was nothing to worry about if you forgot your charger ... there were always other chargers around. But now I have a Motorola, and I am as free as can be. It charges via USB.

What a relief it is, to know that the cable I carry around in my bag with my camera, will also let me charge my cellphone! Way to go, Moto! May the standards be with you.
