The year has hardly begun, and it's already fun!

-  My first stint on the roads in a car, without an instructor. Drove around 25-30km from Dombivali to Titwala. Exhilarating, to say the least ... couldn't get over the excitement for a couple of days.
-  It's now cold enough to use the ultra-soft, ultra-light rajai that we got from Simla. Heaven!
-  The new semester begins ... I hit campus at 9:30, and the place is abuzz with students hurrying to their lectures.

And now looking forward to:

-  My first `publication <http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~sameerds/#publications>`__
-  What is likely to be my last Annual Progress Seminar in late January
-  A conclusion in June to life as a grad student
