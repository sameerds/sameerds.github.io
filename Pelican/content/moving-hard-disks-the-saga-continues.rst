| Life would have been so easy if there was no need to install Windoze on the machine! But can't do without it, since `some software <http://www.celoxica.com/>`__ is available only on the Windoze platform.

| Had started out with a Debian unstable installation with properly planned out partitions and all that. Along comes the Windoze installer, decides that it owns my entire hard disk, and just goes ahead and formats ``/dev/hda1`` to be 40GB, simply ignoring the rest of the partition table!

So here I go again, repartitioning with the Windoze installer CD and making sure it understands it has only 4GB of the available face! Not to mention the fact that for some reason, my board gives up if I connect two hard-disks simultaneously. Wonder how I'll move my data ...
