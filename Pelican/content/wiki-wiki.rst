| Just thought I should note that I finally settled for a sane and simple design on my website. No wiki, for managing it, just plain old php scripts edited by hand. But I do use `DokuWiki <http://www.splitbrain.org/dokuwiki/wiki:dokuwiki>`__ for maintaining my notes. Also `experimenting </~sameerds/wiki/doku.php>`__ with some enhanchements of my own.

| What I learnt from my experiments with PhpWiki
| **Never use a hammer to drive a loose screw!**

| The trouble was that I wanted a wiki for two different purposes - as a
| CMS for my website, and as a means to make notes. But PhpWiki is meant for
| neither - I don't know what it's specifically good for, but it certainly
| didn't serve my purpose!

| Finally I learnt it the hard way - if you want to get work done in a simple
| way, use a simple tool! Also if you want a simple homepage with just basic info
| in it, build the damn thing yourself. And again, use simple tools ... like
| Personal Weblog and Gallery and DokuWiki.
