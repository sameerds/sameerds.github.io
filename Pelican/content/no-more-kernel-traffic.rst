Discovered today that KT has gone inactive now. I had stopped visiting the site after I noticed it hadn't been updated for weeks. Zack says he's taking a break, but the last sentence sounds rather ominous ... "Hopefully Kernel Traffic will not be missed too greatly, with these other useful resources available."

Bye Zack! May the source be with you. You've been a great help to ring-side viewers like me who needed to keep an eye on the kernel but didn't have enough time.

It's sites like KT run by Zack Brown and `Kuro5hin <http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=special;page=mission>`__ by `Rusty <http://www.kuro5hin.org/?op=special;page=random#rusty>`__ that remind me of how lazy I really am.
