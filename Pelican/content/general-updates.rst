Done with the paper presentation, comfortably settled back into the standard low-power "grad" operation mode. This second trip to Bangalore reinforced my infatuation with the city. Good to know that given the current situation of the VLSI Design industry, I am likely to spend a considerable amount of time living in Bangalore after graduating.

Currently working towards the APS, but looking forward to the weekend trip to Mahabaleshwar towards the end of the month, along with `chetanv <http://chetanv.livejournal.com/>`__ and our respective SOs. That, followed by Roger Waters' `trip <http://www.brain-damage.co.uk/2007-tour-zone/february-18th-mmrda-bkc-grounds-mumbai-india.html>`__ to Mumbai next month.
