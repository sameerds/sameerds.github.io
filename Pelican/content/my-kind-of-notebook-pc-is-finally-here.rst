Finally decided that I do need a notebook now. The correct segment for me seems to be ultra-thin notebooks, rather than a netbook. And just in time, here comes the HP DV2. The general `opinion <http://www.techtree.com/India/Reviews/HP_DV2_1003AX_Review/551-101428-616-1.html>`__ `on <http://reviews.cnet.com/laptops/hp-pavilion-dv2/4505-3121_7-33483187.html>`__ `the <http://www.pcworld.com/reviews/product/58935/review/pavilion_dv2.html>`__ `inter-tubes <http://www.notebookreview.com/default.asp?newsID=4963&review=hp+pavilion+dv2>`__ suggests that it's a good buy. It fulfills the following things that I am looking for:

#. Light (it's only 4 pounds ... 1.8kg)
#. Comfortable keyboard
#. 12" screen
#. Decently powerful, for a few things beyond email and surfing.
#. Bluetooth as well as dot-11
#. Large hard-disc
#. "Affordable"

Few questions remain:

#. Does it run Ubuntu? Also, can I "upgrade" the bundled Vista to XP, sitting in India?
#. This product is AMD's way to break into a whole new market segment between netbooks and notebooks. Will better things come along (I think it's not worth waiting)

Unless I hear anything really bad about it soon, I think I'll just go for it.
