| Here's a quote from `Groklaw <http://www.groklaw.net/>`__, an excellent resource for those looking for a well-maintained and comprehensive guide to what's going on day-to-day surrounding the SCO controversy. The editor, `Pamela Jones <http://www.groklaw.net/staticpages/index.php?page=20031004190519196>`__ remarks about her fascination for law while talking about a recent judgement in the `Verizon vs RIAA case <http://www.groklaw.net/article.php?story=20031220172203125>`__.

| The added *emphasis* is mine ...

   This is what I love so much about the law. You hear nasty lawyer jokes all the time, I know. So do I. And when there are decisions in a court that people don't like, it's not unusual to hear some cracks about the judge and the legal system. But my view is that *these folks are what stand between us and chaos, between us and the bully process*, whereby special interests grab whatever they want at the expense of everyone else, based on money and power. The parties naturally fight for what they perceive to be in their best interest. But judges are supposed to look at the bigger picture and to consider the impact on the general public as well. Frankly, *they sometimes seem to be the last ones in the scheme of things still reliably looking at anything but the bottom line*. Decisions are sometimes disapointing, but now and then, a judge stands up and says: we have a rule of law here, and no matter who you are, no matter how much money you have, no matter how powerful your friends are, here in my courtroom, the law is applied fairly and without partiality. When you see it happen, it's a beautiful sight.

..

   Judges don't do what they do for the money. They make an OK living, but there are easier ways to make money, lots more money than a judge will ever see, if he or she is honest. They do it because they love the law and the protections it is meant to provide to everyone, *they love finding the balance, the attempt to decide fairness*, the interplay between private interests and Constitutional guarantees, the opportunity to *figure out what the framers of the Constitution and the lesser laws had in mind in the first place*. The US legal system is based on the fundamental principle that when you go to court, it ought to actually be justice that you get. There has always been an idealism built into the country's judicial branch that moves my heart.
