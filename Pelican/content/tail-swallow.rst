Self reference! Ah, I can see that I made you sit up and take notice. So you thought you liked "Adaptation"? Wait till you take a look at `this <http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~chruska/recursive/selfref.html>`__. But read `this <http://www.math.uchicago.edu/~chruska/recursive/moser.html>`__ before you read that.

BTW, the tag for this entry is "MLP" which stands for "Mindless Link Propagation", first seen on http://kuro5hin.org
