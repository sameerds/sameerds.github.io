| I decided to add a new section to my blog, where I want to talk about everyday people and events, that truly bring out the "`Carpe Diem <http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~sameerds/blog.php?wl_mode=more&wl_eid=32&wl_topic=3>`__" way of life. What better way to start the section, than by describing a posting from the internal newsgroups at IIT Bombay?

| Here's something that I overheard on iitb.general, by someone called Ashwin. I wonder if I'll ever meet him, or the other's nicknamed "Ghoda" and "Machis"; but that's besides the point. For those (like me), who usually lag in the jargon-awareness department, "CG" is the title used for anyone on the "Core Group" that organises Mood Indigo, consisting of roughly 20-25 third-year BTech students.

   | Scene: Fusion nite, whole of OAT bursting to the brim, Shivamani on the
   | drums. CGs are as busy as anything, but manage to grab a few minutes to
   | watch the show. (I was just behind Ghoda and Machis at this time)
   | Shivamani asks for audience participation, and the response is huge,
   | thousands clapping to the drum beats. Ghoda to Machis: "Great response
   | yaar!" And then the two just smiled at each other before moving on. And
   | the contentment on their faces said it all : the slog and sweat put
   | in paying off, it was a small moment which they will cherish forever,
   | and whose simplicity and beauty I will never forget.
