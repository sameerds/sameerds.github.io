Ubuntu is playing with a new idea for desktop notifications ... you can watch a `video on Mark Shuttleworth's blog <http://www.markshuttleworth.com/archives/253/trackback>`__. They are supposed to be ephemeral, non-actionable pop-ups that "are gone like a mystery girl on the bus you didnâ€™t get on" :)

Saw the video, and I say desktop notifications should not appear in the first place. I hope they create the option to turn them off before they start coding those ghastly distracting things! The only thing that I ever want popping up is an event that needs my attention, not want it. In that sense, they should be like the wife that you should not ignore, rather than the mystery girl you shouldn't be worried about anyway!

I've always wondered what it is about the Linux desktop that is so great compared to Windows, and this is one of those features ... the desktop doesn't take your eyes off your work unless it's important! And now, the flagship Linux desktop wants to do just that!
