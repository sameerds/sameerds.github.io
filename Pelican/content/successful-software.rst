Posted a comment on 's journal, and this is what LJ reported:

**Comment Posted Successfully**

Successfully? Somebody at LJ-dot-org not confident enough about support for comments in LJ yet?

UPDATE:

And then when I post this entry, here's what it says:

**Updating journal**... Update successful.

I can bloody well *see* it's been updated, thank you! Could you please take me to my journal's front page instead?
