"Overheard" this in an email "conversation" in `KReSIT <http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/>`__, that I was dragged into, without consent.

*I say bah to world peace! The sooner we screw up this planet the sooner we move out. Europa! here I come.*

UPDATE: `Raghu <http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~raghu/>`__ insists that I acknowledge him for that excellent(?) quote(??)

Interesting to note what Smith says to Morpheus about humanity ...

   You move to an area and you multiply and multiply until every natural resource is consumed and the only way you can survive is to spread to another area. There is another organism on this planet that follows the same pattern. Do you know what it is? A virus. Human beings are a disease, a cancer of this planet. You are a plague. And we are... the cure.
