Read this `comment <http://linux.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=183316&cid=15142369>`__ on the `slashdot article <http://linux.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/04/17/1350239>`__ about Oracle thinking of buying Novell.

   You overreacted. KDE is still very much supported on SuSE. Why jump ship based on a rumour of what someone might possibly do when you can just as easily jump ship later if they ever actually do it. I am on OpenSuSE 10.0 now and the water is just fine.

   Years ago I was worried that what I was doing did not have much of a future and was looking at retraining doing something else. In the end I decided to carry on with what I was already specialised in and cross that bridge (retraining) when I came to it. I am still working on the same platform 20 years later, still worried that it is going to run out at some point but have noticed that some of the alternatives I was looking at back then no longer exist.

   Don't panic.

Nice advice, really. Would fit right in with the `list of things that you wish you were told when you were a kid <http://paulgraham.com/hs.html>`__.
