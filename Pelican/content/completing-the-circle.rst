I have always fancied myself as a small-time free software contributor, fixing a line of code here, filing a useful bug report there, and occasionally jumping into discussions. But finally IÂ got around to putting in a concrete contribution that is worth mentioning. The latest version of `Dia <http://live.gnome.org/Dia>`__ is about to be `released <http://mail.gnome.org/archives/dia-list/2009-May/msg00001.html>`__, and I have been responsible for scratching an itch that has been bothering people `for years <http://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=60331>`__.

And in case you are an engineer that has to create lots of schematics, and you don't know what Dia is, it's high time you tried it out!
