General conversation sitting on the KReSIT lawns turns towards aliens landing on planet Earth:

"If aliens land here, won't the laugh at us? Considering all those foolish depictions of aliens in Hollywood flicks"?

"Wonder if that's really true ... even they would have had similar concepts once upon a time ... *woh kya aasman se thode hi tapke hain?* Although, that is true in some sense!"

"Boss, aliens jab asman se tapkenge, *to kya khajoor me atkenge?*"

;) And once again, have to mention `Raghu <http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~raghu/>`__ for the last line!
