Here's stuff that could inspire a PhD comic! :)

Location: S24, the place where two old-timers from CSE can be found at random times of the day ... me and yogi, basically.

Time: about five minutes ago, late evening with the natural light going down to unacceptable levels.

Action.

In walks another RS, , and is about to say "Hi!". Instead I grab the opportunity and pre-empt him with a quick "Can you switch on the light please!" He is dazed, but I am dazed even further when Yogi (aka `Preetam Patil <http://ppatil.wordpress.com/>`__) says "Yeah, I have been hoping Sam will get up to turn it on!"
