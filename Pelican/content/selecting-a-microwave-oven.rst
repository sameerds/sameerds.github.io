Took a stroll in the kitchen-ware section of the friendly neighbourhood mall, looking at microwave ovens. We intend to buy one some time soon, but weren't sure what to look for, when selecting one. Here's a list of features to consider, that I collected through some searches on the net. I ask the experienced among you ... which of these are relevant? Which are the must-haves, and the dont-cares?

#. The user interface --- the front panel --- is there anything really convenient or really inconvenient to look out for, considering common daily usage, in the buttons, displays and settings?
#. The interior --- most are stainless steel, while others are some kind of polymer on metal or something. Which one lasts? And is also easy to clean?
#. Same for the door --- some have plastic doors, while others have metal doors. I don't suppose anyone uses glass for the transparent area, but if there is one with glass, will definitely consider that a plus point.
#. The net recommends checking for grease filters that are easy to clean. Is that a big deal?
   Delayed start timer --- almost all ovens seem to have that, these days.
#. Keep-warm modes after cooking
#. Turntable, easily removable to facilitate cooking
#. Safety interlocks on the door
#. Variable power setting (same as temperature?)
#. Sensors to detect food done (I find this indistinguishable from magic, is technology sufficiently advanced to actually deliver this kind of functionality?)
#. Weight sensor to decide settings (kinda made sense to me when I saw one which had this)
#. Microwave/Grill/Convection --- we decided we don't expect to be baking any cakes. But the grill seems like a "just-in-case" item that one might prove handy some time
#. And finally, manufacturers --- which ones to totally avoid, and which ones to consider important enough to compromise on a feature above? Bajaj seems to be the only one that gives a one-year replacement guarantee. I liked the look of Onida ovens, but the flat interface of Panasonic ones seemed more convenient.
