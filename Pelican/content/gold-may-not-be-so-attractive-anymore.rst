   Gold has been a reasonably good investment for [the Indian investor] over the last few decades. And that’s not because gold has been a fundamentally strong asset. But because over most of the last three decades, the Indian Rupee actually lost value vis-à-vis the US Dollar. Yes, exactly the opposite of what you have witnessed this year.

      </p>

    The result was that even though the price of gold in US Dollar terms declined over most of this period, [the Indian investor] actually gained because the depreciation in the value of the Indian Rupee vis-à-vis the Dollar, more than made up for it!

   If you believe that we are entering an era of a stronger Indian Rupee, then you should know that it is the fundamentals of gold which will drive the future price of gold; not any other factor as in the past.
