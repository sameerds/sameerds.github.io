I got a reply from ICICI ... imagine the warm fuzzy feeling I experienced to know that they "regret the inconvenience" caused to me! The email I sent got submitted twice ... so waiting for a second dose of that warm fuzzy feeling.

Note to fellow ICICI sufferers: If you file a service request, and receive an email, don't forget to look beyond the disclaimer at the end ... it's usually the place where they put more important information about the service request.
