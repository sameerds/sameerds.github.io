The photos from the Visapur trek are up! `(here) <http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~abhijit/photos/>`__ These were taken from Abhijit's digital camera ...

That was one nice trek - very easy to climb, so easy in fact that we spent a lot of time just roaming along the way, and of course, having a great time in the streams! Visapur is a huge fort ... and so is Lohagad next to it. We walked a little more than three kilometers along the outer wall of the fort but still got to see only half of it!
