Yesterday was a major `night out <http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~shantanu/bartending.html>`__ in the hostel wing ... among other activities, one major accomplishment was getting to appreciate rock music in general, and Pink Floyd in particular.

   Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain

   And then one day you find that ten years have got behind you
   No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun
