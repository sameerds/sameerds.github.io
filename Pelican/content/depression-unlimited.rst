Recently earned a new name ... "Darwin"!

People around here seem to have been bugged pretty bad by my generally depressed attitude. The last time I used my favourite remark, "*Man, this is not just pathetic, its downright depressing!*" dear old Shantanu got so bugged, he started looking for a new name.

Darwin, is a take-off on Marvin, the paranoid android, the perpetually depressed robot, from the Hitch Hikers' Guide, that goes "*Here I am, with a brain the size of a planet, and all they ask me to do is open doors!*"

"*Shut up*," Shantanu had said, "*you think you are Marvin?*" ... and I had remarked rather passionately that Marvin was better off than I was!

That's how I ended up with my new name ... Darwin! SameerDS - that's me! Know my middle name? Its DARWIN ... even Marwin's afraid of me!
