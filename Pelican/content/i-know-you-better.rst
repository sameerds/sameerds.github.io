I was reading an article about how Google+ is the future.

`Why the Google+ long game isÂ brilliant <http://venturebeat.com/2013/01/05/why-the-google-long-game-is-brilliant/>`__

The author is trying to make a point, and I get it. But when skimming, I just picked up the lines in bold:

-  I live in Gmail.
-  Google Voice is my phone number.
-  Google Hangouts is my new calendar invite.
-  I live in Chrome.

| And then when I reached the end, I half-expected the following conclusion:
| ... *and in case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!*
