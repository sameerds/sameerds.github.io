I'd always been "left out" of the blogging scene simply because I couldn't get myself around to shift to livejournal. I've been writing rather infrequently on my own site, though.

| Finally, here I am ... on LJ! I had tried command-line clients a year ago, that would help me upload my MySQL based blog to LJ. But I gave up, after some frustrating attempts at batch mode submissions through proxies. This time around, I managed to pull it off in two hours, and I have the time stamps to prove it!

| It's all thanks to `JLJ <http://www.cis.rit.edu/~jerry/Software/perl/#jlj>`__, the perl based command-line client. It has a nifty queuing system that can upload a bunch of entries from simple-to-edit text files. All it took was a perl script that dumped back-dated entries into serially numbered files. JLJ did its magic after that.

Now about the time-stamps ... was chatting with `vipul <http://vipul.livejournal.com/>`__ when I re-embarked on this grand endeavour. He discovers that I had created this account exactly two years and one day ago! Co-incidence? Divine plans?

Anyway, also pasting a log of our conversation ... a partial account of the events that led to this posting. Makes me feel like Charlie Kaufman.

   | (21:30:23) sameerds: hey you there?
   | (21:30:36) vipulmathur: ya
   | (21:31:04) sameerds: i am back in upload-blog-to-livejournal mode :D
   | (21:31:19) vipulmathur: wah wah
   | (21:31:22) sameerds: thinking of trying out the command line clients and see if any of them can work in batch mode
   | (21:31:36) vipulmathur: interesting :)
   | (21:31:38) sameerds: so i can dump my own blog entries and put them up backdated on livejournal
   | (21:31:50) vipulmathur: ya.. good idea
   | (21:31:59) sameerds: thought i should do a quick check and see if you've heard of a way
   | (21:32:15) vipulmathur: might want to look at some of the gui clients as well... they might have an "import" feature
   | (21:32:29) vipulmathur: dunno of any exact one though
   | (21:32:53) sameerds: ok JLJ seems to have an offline mode, and the release file says the "queue file" is documented
   | (21:32:58) sameerds: maybe that's all i'll need
   | (21:33:06) sameerds: stay tuned for updates B-)
   | (21:33:45) vipulmathur: :) kewl

   | (21:49:01) sameerds: now all i need is a script to dump my blog in the original format
   | (21:49:31) vipulmathur: I just saw the transition from "updated 59 weeks ago" to "updated 48 seconds ago" :D
   | (21:49:37) sameerds: hehe
   | (21:50:16) vipulmathur: so has the dream come true? :>

   | (21:51:36) sameerds: right
   | (21:52:06) sameerds: one more entry ... just checking if renaming the queue files works ...
   | (21:52:34) sameerds: hmmm ... now its time for perl, and perldb ... since my blog is in mysql
   | (21:52:57) vipulmathur: hmm
   | (21:53:55) vipulmathur: you created your LJ account 1 year and one day + delta ago?
   | (21:54:02) vipulmathur: oops 2 years
   | (21:54:21) sameerds: why do you reckon that?
   | (21:54:35) sameerds: because of the entry?
   | (21:55:06) sameerds: "last updated 59 weeks ago" ... remember?
   | (21:55:26) sameerds: that entry i made was just a try at back dating ... changed the year for a new test entry in the queue
   | (21:55:45) vipulmathur: ya but 59 weeks == 1 year+ some weeks
   | (21:55:50) sameerds: oh ok
