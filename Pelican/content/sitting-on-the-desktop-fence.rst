A long long time ago, I first saw a true Desktop for Linux when KDE was first announced. But later came GNU's response in the form of GNOME, with its radical focus on desktop usability. Once I switched to GNOME, I never felt like going back to KDE inspite of the warts. Things have come full circle now, with KDE taking some great steps towards usability. It seems now that I just might decide to switch when `KDE 4.1 <http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080627-first-look-kde-4-1-beta-2-shows-solid-improvements.html>`__ is released.

And yeah, I know, believe and rejoice in the all-powerful command line, but using a desktop does not in any way take away its power. For some simple yet frequent things in life, the command line is simply not enough.
