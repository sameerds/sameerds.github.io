| I usually ignore the articles in the Science section on slashdot after a quick look at the summary. But `this one <http://science.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=06/08/07/1222245>`__ generated some pretty informative comments. Do read `this comment <http://science.slashdot.org/comments.pl?sid=193313&cid=15859776>`__:
