Just noticed this weekend that I don't seem to have any control over ads that LiveJournal shows on my blog. Was browsing on a borrowed PC with no AdBlock, and was shocked to see the right side occupied by a huge flash video of a blonde teenager seemingly chatting on a laptop and "pointing downwards".

How do I get out of this mess? Can I choose which ads show up on livejournal? Or should I jump ship already?
