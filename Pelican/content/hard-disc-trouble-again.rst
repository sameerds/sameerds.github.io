but Debian makes it sooooo painless!

The 40GB hdd that I had shifted to, crashed some time ago ... and my trusty old 20GB is on the last legs of its "revolutionary" life. So, here we go again, moving house ... but with the automagical chroot install, you move everything - even the kitchen sink!

| But as always, there's a dark side to everything, and its invariably caused by the hordes of Mammon out there in Win-Win land! A modeling software I was using kinda loved the old hard-disc ... wouldn't run on the new one - "Invalid license," it said, "incorrect disc ID!" So here I am, waiting for yet another license request to come through!
