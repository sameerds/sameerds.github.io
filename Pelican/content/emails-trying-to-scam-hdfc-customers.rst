IMPORTANT

If you receive an email claiming to be from HDFC bank, be careful. I just received an email that asked me to click on a link. The image below is a screenshot of the email as it appears in thunderbird.

Note that in the screenshot, the text "Netbanking Log-in Review" does NOT link to the HDFC Bank website. The actual link can be seen at the bottom of the screenshot, next to the light bulb image. This link is visible when you move your mouse over the blue text, but unfortunately, the screenshot did not capture the mouse pointer.

I tried reporting this to HDFC Bank, but the idiots who made that website have taken every possible effort to not reveal their customer service email address on the website.
