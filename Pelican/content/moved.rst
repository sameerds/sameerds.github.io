Shifted this weekend from a rented flat in Powai to one in Dindoshi ... quite close to Dindoshi Depot. It means a hefty increase in my commute time, going from basically nil to 40-plus minutes! But this will be good for Meenal, who's work is shifting to the new IFlex building near Movie Time.

Currently living out of boxes since we have no furniture of our own, and the flat has none. Made one visit to the old furniture shops in Oshiwara ... excellent stuff! Plan to start by buying a refurbished entirely-teak closet for clothes. We were also eyeing a counter with drawers and cupboards underneath, that would be just right for the TV.

More updates as things happen!
