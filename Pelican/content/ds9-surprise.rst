I had initially been rather skeptical about Star Trek - Deep Space 9 ... but well into the second season, I am beginning to like it! Quite different from the other Star Trek story-lines, the characters in this one come in all hues and shades.

Was particularly amused by one scene from an episode I watched today, that introduces the Maqui ... we see Quark, the Firangi bartender on DS9, explaining war in terms of business to Sakonna, a Vulcan member of the Maqui

| **Quark:**   | Now ... the Third Rule clearly states that "never     |
|              | spend more for an acquisition, than you have to."     |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| **Sakonna:** | Logical, but I fail to see how that applies to my     |
|              | situation.                                            |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| **Quark:**   | You want to acquire peace. Fine. Peace is good.       |
|              | But, how much're you willing to pay for it?           |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| **Sakonna:** | Whatever it costs.                                    |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| **Quark:**   | That's the kind of irresponsible spending that        |
|              | causes so many business ventures to fail. You're      |
|              | forgetting the Third Rule. Right now, peace could be  |
|              | bought at a bargain price, and you don't even realise |
|              | it.                                                   |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| **Sakonna:** | I find this very confusing.                           |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| **Quark:**   | harrr ... then I'll make it so simple that even a     |
|              | Vulcan can understand.                                |
