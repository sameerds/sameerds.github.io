| F.C. Kohli had visited KReSIT yesterday, and delivered a free talk on where India stands today in IT age and how there's a lot to be done, with a bright future for the young generation. But two points that he made really stuck out in the entire session ...
| 
| About the general development efforts in the country, he remarked

   *All these are only attempts at optimising the sub-systems. Optimising subsystems has never resulted in a better overall system!*

He was also pretty passionate about introducing computers in the municipal schools, but pointed out the obvious that everyone has always managed to miss:

   *Yes, I do want to introduce computers in schools, but not in order to make the children computer literate. The computers should be given to the teacher, to be used as a tool. The teacher should be trained to use the computer, in order to enhance the education being imparted to the children!*
