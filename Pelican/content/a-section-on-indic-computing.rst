| Recently started a new section on `Indic Computing </~sameerds/indic/>`__. It started as an intial post on a mailing list, explaining to people what "unicode" means and what's the difference between "fonts" and "encodings" ... there's not much on it currently, but I hope to start putting in some useful stuff and links to relevant sites, especially those related to Indianization of the GNU. Hope to use PhpWiki and mod_rewrite to manage the "/indic/" section.
