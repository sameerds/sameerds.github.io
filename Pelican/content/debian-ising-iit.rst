Ok, so a lot of people in KReSIT have started using Debian. But havn't managed to get Prof. Arya to shift over to it yet! Where do we go from here? Liberating the whole institute from an infestation of Dead Rats, Salamanders, Magicians ... ;) Kinda sounds like the borg, doesn't it?

| Too bad the Debian ftp mirror on campus isn't maintained anymore ... so Debian fans are trying to put together their own caching-proxies. Best part is that the HoD of CSE, Prof. Siva has been assimilated now, and we can already see IBM PCs coming installed with Knoppix in CSE!

Here's a short list of the major conspirators (former victims, maybe?):

-  `Bhattacharya, Shouryapratap <http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~shourya/>`__
-  `Godbole, Shantanu R. <http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~shantanu/>`__
-  `Mathur, Vipul <http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/vipul/>`__
-  `Patil, Preetam <http://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~yogi/>`__
-  `Sahasrabuddhe, Sameer D. <http://www.it.iitb.ac.in/~sameerds/>`__ (me! me! In case you didn't notice ...)
