| While the rest of the world goes into the terabyte age, I make a small move for myself ... shifting from a 20GB hard disk to a 40GB one. Tried out PGI aka `piggy <http://hackers.progeny.com/pgi/>`__, the cute little GUI installer for Debian. But it doesn't seem to have an option to use Reiserfs, which is what I want to try out. So its back to one of the netinst CD images, the only problem is that the installer seems to have a 1024-cylinder limit, although LILO itself should not have a problem. So need to repartition, since I didn't consider that while making the initial partitions!
