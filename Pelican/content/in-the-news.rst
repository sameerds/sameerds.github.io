The publication at VLSI07 seems to have attracted media attention. EE Times is running an `article <http://www.eetimes.com/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=196902462>`__ about it! They mailed saying they wrote about our work in their online edition, and now want to do a print version too! The article sure makes our work seem much larger than life!

This can be good if we end up with a startup based on our work ... seems like a good idea too, what with all the VLSI design boom visible in our country.
