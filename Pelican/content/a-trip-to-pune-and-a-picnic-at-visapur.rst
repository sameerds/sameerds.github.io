Returned today from a general trip to Pune, that included a trek with the Veritas guys. Shantanu, Raghu, Ashish and I left for Pune on Friday evening in Raghu's car and returned today pre-lunch after a rather interesting stay for two days.

After a lot of indecisive discussion, we went off to Visapur for a trek on Saturday morning. What was supposed to be a rather nice trek, turned out to be more of a picnic, since Visapur is so damn easy to climb!

| Details coming up later when Abhijit, the MTech99 guy who now works in Veritas, manages to upload the photos. He has his own complaints about the Sysads (that includes me) about disk space, but that's a different story.
