After I became a father, the one question that has been asked most frequently is, of course, "So, how does it feel to be a father?". It's impossible to describe that feeling in words, but here are a few things so you get the hint:

#. When you have just become a father, it's okay to walk down the road with a completely silly smile slapped on your face. You can't control it any way, so why bother!
#. Compared to the experience of becoming parents, the experience of being married is like holding a candle to the sun.
#. The one thing that you will want to do is sit next to the baby and just keep looking at her. Go ahead and do that, it's amazing ... you'll never notice how time flies by.
#. And an important thing to remember:Â Try not to fight with your spouse about who gets to hold the baby more!
